You might find it useful to use an example repository as a point of reference during tutorials. For that do the following:

    $ mkdir -p ~/git             # Make sure we're filing this away into a tidy folder :-)
    $ cd ~/git

    $ git clone https://github.com/taikedzierski-ldx/git-refreshers-examples

    $ cd git-refreshers-examples

You should be able to following along and try out various commands.

If you think you broke the repository:

* ask for help, to understand
* if that is not possible, discard the repository, and download a fresh copy
